# RSA Factoring Challenge

**RSA** *(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)* is a [Public-Key Cryptosystem/Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) algorithm that is widely used for secure data transmission. The name **RSA** is an acronym from the surnames of the 3 inventors of this wonderful data security algorithm: **(*Ron Rivest*, *Adi Shamir*,** and ***Leonard Adleman*)** in the year 1973.

As regards the RSA algorithm being based on the public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private). An RSA algorithm user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decoded by someone who knows the prime numbers.

The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem".

## How RSA Data Security Algorithm is Generated and Used

The process of generating and using this algorithm is in 4 different stages:

- [Key Generation](#key-gen)
- [Key Distribution](#key-dist)
- [Data Encryption](#enc)
- [Data Decryption](#dec)
